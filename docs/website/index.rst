**Bounded Lᴛʟ sAtisfiability ChecKer**

Welcome to **BLACK**'s website.

BLACK is a tool for testing the satisfiability of formulas in Linear
Temporal Logic (LTL) and related logics. 

LTL is a very popular specification language in the fields of *formal
verification* and *artificial intelligence*. In these fields, it is important to
be able to understand whether a given specification is satisfiable,
unsatisfiable, or vacuously true. BLACK helps with this task.

BLACK is open-source and released under the MIT license. For its source code,
look at its `GitHub repository <https://github.com/black-sat/black>`_.
