Command-line interface
======================

BLACK's main interface to the user is the command-line tool ``black``. Here we
document its usage. For the input syntax accepted by the tool, look at the
:doc:`syntax` page.

Tutorial
--------

The main purpose of ``black`` is to tell you whether a given temporal logic
formula (see :doc:`logics`) is *satisfiable*. Let's suppose you have written
such a formula in the file ``spec.pltl``::

   $ cat spec.pltl
   !p & X !p & F p

Then, asking ``black`` about this formula is as easy as::

   $ black solve spec.pltl
   SAT

``black`` replies ``SAT`` on the *standard output*, so the formula is
satisfiable. Let us try an unsatisfiable formula::

   $ cat unsat-spec.pltl
   G((p & q) & c) & F((w & r) & !c)

   $ black solve unsat-spec.pltl
   UNSAT

If the filename is ``-``, ``black`` reads from the *standard input*::

   $ cat spec.pltl | black solve -
   SAT

   $ cat unsat-spec.pltl | black solve -
   UNSAT

This is useful when the formulas are generated by other programs.

Alternatively, we may give the formulas on the command line with the
``-f`` option::

   $ black solve -f '!p & X !p & F p'
   SAT

   $ black solve -f 'G((p & q) & c) & F((w & r) & !c)'
   UNSAT

.. tip::

   Formulas usually contain spaces so they have to be quoted. Moreover, they 
   usually contain many symbols which have special meaning for the shell, 
   therefore it is recommended to use single quotes (``'like this'``) rather 
   than double quotes (``"not this"``) to tell the shell to not interpret the 
   quoted contents.

.. topic:: Design choice
   
   Note how ``black``'s output is so short and terse. By default, the tool only 
   shows its result and quits, without any other information of any sort. This 
   behavior is useful when calling ``black`` from shell scripts or from other 
   programs: there is no need to parse complex logs of information to 
   understand the result.

Satisfiable formulas can correspond *e.g.*, to bugged specifications or planning
problems that admit a solution plan. In these cases, one may want to obtain the
counter-example showing the bug or the solution plan to the planning problem. 
To do this, we can ask ``black`` to print the *model* of a satisfiable formula 
with the ``-m`` option::

   $ black solve -m -f '!p & X !p & F p'
   SAT
   Model:
   - t = 0: {￢p}
   - t = 1: {￢p}
   - t = 2: {p} ⬅︎ loops here

By default, ``black`` solves formulas with the *infinite trace* semantics (see
:doc:`logics`). So here it is telling us that the model of the formula starts
with two states at ``t=0`` and ``t=1`` where ``p`` does *not* hold, followed by
a state where ``p`` holds, and then the model infinitely loops through this last
state. LTL models always loop in this way. 

If, instead, we want to interpret the formula over *finite* traces, we can tell 
so to ``black`` by passing the ``--finite`` option::

   $ black solve --finite -m -f '!p & X !p & F p'
   SAT
   Finite model:
   - t = 0: {￢p}
   - t = 1: {￢p}
   - t = 2: {p}

Note that the model does not loop anymore, but ends at ``t=2``.

Complex specifications may have huge and complex models, and we probably want to
process the output model with other scripts or programs. In this case, we need
``black`` to print the model in a more easily parsable format. The ``-o`` option
lets us choose the output format. Currently supported formats are ``readable``
(the default, that we saw above), or ``json``::

   $ black solve -o json -m -f '!p & X !p & F p'
   {
      "result": "SAT",
      "k": 1,
      "model": {
         "size": 3,
         "loop": 2,
         "states": [
            {
               "p": "false"
            },
            {
               "p": "false"
            },
            {
               "p": "true"
            }
         ]
      }
   }

.. tip:: 

   If you need to parse ``black``'s output from shell scripts or from the 
   command line, consider using the ``json`` output format and the 
   `jq <https://stedolan.github.io/jq/>`_ command-line JSON manipulation tool.

BLACK supports many backends. The list of available backends can be retrieved 
with the ``--sat-backends`` option::

   $ black --sat-backends

   BLACK - Bounded Lᴛʟ sAtisfiability ChecKer
        version 0.8.2

   Available SAT backends:
   - z3 *
   - cmsat 
   - cvc5
   - mathsat
   - minisat

The one marked with ``*`` is the default used when no explicit choice is made.
To choose the backend, use the ``-B`` option::

   $ black solve -B cvc5 -f '!p & X !p & F p'
   SAT

Note that not all backends support the same features. In particular, first-order
formulas are only supported with SMT solver backends (``z3``, ``cvc5`` and
``mathsat``), and only ``z3`` and ``cvc5`` support *quantified* first-order
formulas.

Now, let's consider again the unsatisfiable formula above. Why is it
unsatisfiable? ``black`` can help us answer this question by finding a *minimum
unsatisfiable core* (MUC). This can be done by passing the ``-c`` option::

   $ black solve -c -f 'G((p & q) & c) & F((w & r) & !c)'
   UNSAT
   MUC: G({0} & c) & F({1} & !c)

Let us look at the output. ``UNSAT`` is printed because the formula is
unsatisfiable. Then, the MUC is shown to be ``G({0} & c) & F({1} & !c)``. This
is a reduction of the original formulas, where the subformula ``(p & q)`` has
been replaced by ``{0}`` and the subformula ``(w & r)`` has been replaced by
``{1}``. Let's try to give this formula back to ``black``::

   $ black solve -f 'G({0} & c) & F({1} & !c)'
   UNSAT

The formula is unsatisfiable. Indeed, the MUC is the smallest *unsatisfiable*
formula obtained by replacing some subformulas of the original one with
propositional placeholders. It tells us that the replaced subformulas are not
involved at all in the unsatisfiability of the formula. In this case, from the
MUC it can be seen directly that the formula is unsatisfiable because we require
``c`` to always hold and then we require ``!c`` to hold eventually.

------------

Until now, we have always given to ``black`` propositional formulas. But as you
can see in the :doc:`logics` page, ``black`` also supports first-order formulas
in place of propositional letters (*i.e.*, the |LTLfMT| logic).

In this logic, we can use *variables* that take values over certains domains.
Since BLACK supports the LIA and LRA theories (possibly combined with EUF),
variables can be either *integer*- or *real*-valued. When giving a |LTLfMT|
formula as input, we have to choose the domain using the ``-d`` option. Accepted
values are ``integers`` and ``reals``::

   $ black solve -d integers -f 'x = y + 2'
   SAT

.. note:: 

   The ``-m`` option is not (yet) supported for |LTLfMT| formulas.

.. note:: 

   The ``--finite`` option is implied when solving |LTLfMT| formulas, since the 
   infinite-trace semantics is not supported for such formulas.

We can refer to the value of a variable at the next state using the *strong* or
the *weak next* term constructors. For example::

   $ black solve -d integers -f 'x = 0 & G(wnext(x) = x + 1) & F(x = 42)'
   black: warning: use of `next`/`prev` terms implies the --semi-decision option.
   black: warning: execution may not terminate.
   black: warning: pass the --semi-decision option explicitly to silence this warning.
   SAT

As you can see, ``black`` warns you about the fact that, by using such terms,
the solving procedure may not terminate (in the case of unsatisfiable formulas),
hence ``black`` turns on implicitly the ``--semi-decision`` option which
disables the termination checks. To silence the warning, you can pass the 
option yourself (here we use the ``-s`` short option)::

   $ black solve -s -d integers -f 'x = 0 & G(wnext(x) = x + 1) & F(x = 42)'
   SAT

.. note:: 

   You can use the ``-s`` option on propositional formulas as well. This may
   cause ``black`` to not terminate on unsatisfiable instances, but can
   substantially speed up it on satisfiable ones.
